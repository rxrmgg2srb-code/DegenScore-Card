# DegenScore: The Credit Score for Crypto Degenerates
## Whitepaper v2.0

**"Your reputation is your wealth. Prove it on-chain."**

---

## Abstract

DegenScore is a gamified reputation protocol on Solana that transforms on-chain trading history into verifiable, tradeable NFTs with dynamic scoring. We combine advanced analytics, viral tokenomics, and social gaming to create the first **self-sustaining trading reputation ecosystem** in crypto.

Unlike traditional analytics dashboards, DegenScore creates **economic incentives** for participation, **social proof** for traders, and **composable primitives** for DeFi protocols to assess user quality.

**Target Market**: $50B+ crypto trading analytics market
**Blockchain**: Solana (400ms finality, $0.00025 transaction cost)
**Revenue Model**: Multi-stream SaaS + token economy
**Projected Year 1 Revenue**: $5M+ with no external funding required

## 1. The Problem

### 1.1 Trust Crisis in Crypto

In traditional finance, credit scores enable trustless lending. In crypto, **there is no standardized reputation system**. This creates:

- **Information Asymmetry**: Whales and degens look identical on-chain
- **Sybil Attacks**: One trader can appear as 1000 wallets
- **No Accountability**: Influencers can shill without consequences
- **Missed Alpha**: Good traders have no way to prove their edge

### 1.2 Broken Analytics Tools

Current solutions (Solscan, Birdeye, DexScreener) are:
- **Passive**: No incentive to use them regularly
- **Non-Social**: No community or competition
- **Non-Monetizable**: No way for users to earn from their skill
- **Not Composable**: Can't be used by other protocols

**Result**: 95% of crypto traders lose money, and 99% of "alpha" is fake.

### 1.3 Market Opportunity

- **50M+ crypto traders globally** (growing 40% YoY)
- **$2.3T daily trading volume** on-chain
- **$50B+ analytics market** (TradingView, Bloomberg Terminal, etc.)
- **0 dominant players** in on-chain reputation

**The gap is massive. DegenScore fills it.**

---

## 2. The Solution

### 2.1 Core Value Proposition

DegenScore is the **LinkedIn + FICO Score + Pokémon Cards** of crypto trading.

We provide:

1. **Proof of Skill**: Verifiable on-chain trading performance (no cheating)
2. **Social Currency**: NFT trading cards that flex your edge
3. **Economic Incentives**: Earn $DEGEN tokens by being a good trader
4. **DeFi Composability**: Your score can be used for loans, whitelists, alpha groups
5. **Viral Growth**: Multi-level referrals + gamification = exponential user acquisition

### 2.2 The "Aha!" Moment

**Traditional**:
"I made 10x on $BONK" → No one believes you → No benefit

**DegenScore**:
"I made 10x on $BONK" → Wallet verified → NFT minted → DegenScore: 92/100 → Badge: "Moonshot Master" → $DEGEN rewards → Featured on leaderboard → Followers + respect

**The score becomes STATUS. Status = value.**

## 3. How It Works

### 3.1 For Users (Traders)

#### Step 1: Connect Wallet
User connects their Solana wallet (Phantom, Backpack, Solflare).

#### Step 2: AI Analysis
Our engine analyzes **100,000+ transactions** in ~30 seconds:
- Every swap, every token, every profit/loss
- Detects moonshots (100x+ gains)
- Detects rugs (tokens that went to zero)
- Calculates real win rate, volatility, hold time

#### Step 3: DegenScore Generated (0-100)
Algorithm weighs 9 factors:
- **Profit/Loss** (30 points): Actual SOL made/lost
- **Win Rate** (20 points): % of profitable trades
- **Volume** (10 points): Total SOL traded
- **Moonshots** (+10 points): 100x+ gains
- **Rugs** (-15 points): Got rugged
- **Diamond Hands** (+10 points): Held winners >30 days
- **Quick Flips** (-10 points): Paperhanded in <1 hour
- **Volatility** (-10 points): Risky behavior penalty
- **Activity** (10 points): Consistency bonus

#### Step 4: NFT Minted
User pays 1 SOL → NFT minted on-chain with:
- Unique visual design
- Dynamic metadata (score updates)
- 5% royalties to treasury
- Tradeable on Magic Eden, Tensor

#### Step 5: Enter the Ecosystem
- **Compete** in weekly challenges (prizes: $DEGEN)
- **Refer** friends (earn 20% of their $DEGEN)
- **Stake** $DEGEN for VIP perks (5x rewards)
- **Flex** on Twitter (social proof)

### 3.2 For DeFi Protocols

DegenScore NFTs are **composable primitives**:

- **Lending Protocols**: Use score for undercollateralized loans
- **Alpha DAOs**: Whitelist only DegenScore >80 traders
- **Launchpads**: Priority access based on score
- **Perpetuals DEXs**: Lower fees for high-score users

**We become the Chainlink Oracle for trader reputation.**
